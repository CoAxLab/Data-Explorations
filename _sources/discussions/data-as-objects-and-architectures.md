# Discussion questions

1. Provide 2 hypothetical examples of how “dirty” (aka- not tidy) data tables could hamper data analysis.

2. The concept of a tidy data table is linked to the goals of the analysis to be done. Give an example where the same data table would be considered tidy for one set of questions but not tidy for another (and vice versa). Use a spreadsheet or table in a text editor to show your examples.
