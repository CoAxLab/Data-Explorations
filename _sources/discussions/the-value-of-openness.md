# Discussion questions

1. Describe a hypothetical experiment and how each of the three types of reproducibility can break down in that experiment. How does a breakdown in one type of reproducibility lead to impacts in the others?

2. Open science practices are proposed as panacea for problems in reproducibility. Provide an example of how open science practices (as proposed by Sandve et al. 2013) could hurt one or more of the types of reproducibility.
