# Discussion questions

1. Provide another example (i.e., not the pizza deal scenario presented by Guest & Martin 2020) where an informal, intuitive theory would incorrectly predict something that a quantitative/computational theory would accurately predict.

2. Van Rooij and Baggio 2020 claimed that all theories in psychology (and I proposed in neuroscience as well) are descriptions of capacities. How does the definition of the capacity determine the form of the theory used to describe it (hint: think Marrâ€™s levels of analyses)?

# Solo submission:
3. Describe a theory that you work with in your research, the scope of the theory (which of marrs level(s) are most relevant), and outline the set of plausibility constraints (what makes it a formal theory), if it is not, what constraints could be imposed?
