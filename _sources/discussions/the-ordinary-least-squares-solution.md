# Discussion questions: 

1. How is a likelihood function different from a regression model? Provide a verbal description of both.

2. We have gone over three different model evaluation metrics: RSE, $r^2$, & F-test. In what contexts would each method be preferred over the others? Provide one example for all three metrics.
