# Discussion questions

1. Yanai & Lercher (2020) made the case that being narrowly focused on hypotheses can result in missing meaningful patterns in your data. How do you reconcile their conclusion with the case made in the theory lectures that data analysis should be hypothesis driven?

2. Give two hypothetical examples in psychology or neuroscience where the encoding process of unstructured information via data visualization can bias the knowledge (and understanding) extracted when the reader decodes the information.
