# Discussion questions

1.	The “Workflow Specification” step of the of audited data pipeline involves defining a set of automated checks with specification (e.g., determining if the value range is appropriate (e.g., excluding people who are 127 years old), looking for NaN). Can you generate a list of possible anomalies that could arise within data and how you would implement that automation (e.g., set a range of allowable values (18 < participantAge < 90)). Feel free to examine data you are currently working with for inspiration. Moreover, are there any existing tools (e.g., python libraries / R libraries) that exist for implementing this automation.

2.	How can steps that you take in your data cleansing pipeline potentially harm the mapping between the “real world” and your data table? Provide a specific example to illustrate your answer.
