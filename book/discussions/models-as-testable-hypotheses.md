1. Provide two examples of a hypothesis, one stated in a falsifiable manner the other stated in an unfalsifiable manner. Explain why one can be falsified and the other cannot.

2. In Plattâ€™s argument for strong inference, he pushed the idea of conditional inductive trees as a way of defining a structured way of evaluating hypotheses before evidence is collected. Provide an example of a 3-step conditional inductive tree for an imaginary psychological or neuroscientific series of experiments.
