# Discussion questions

1. The breast cancer screening example at the reading and lecture shows how evidentiary and existential methods can arrive at similar conclusions. Mayo makes the case that the existential, error statistics approach provides a better window towards understanding errors. Is that the only benefit of the approach? In what ways does the evidentiary, Bayesian approach offer insights that the existnetial, error statistics approach does not?

2. How does Mayo's concept of severe hypothesis tests relate to Popper's idea of falsifiabilty? In what ways do they differ?
